# K---Nearest-Neighbour
Implementation of K-NN as part of the curriculum
In the following attached diagram let blue circles indicate positive examples and orange squares indicate negative examples. We want to use k-NN algorithm for classifying the points. If k=3, find the class of the point (6, 6). Extend the same example for Distance-Weighted k-NN and locally weighted Averaging:
